            Uriel Sabah - 200629020; <br/>
            I did the basic framework.. the Cart, Checkout, Login and Register files,
            (and their functions in server and repository) and took care of the tests and general style.
             <br/>
            Uriel did the App, Admin Screen (and reading/writing from/to file),
            Products, Product, TextInput files, and their respective functions in the server and repository files.
            Also did Purchases.

          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            We used cookie session to keep the user as long as he wants and every request to the
            server is being protected by the cookie server token. There is a secret key used in each
            request to validate it. Only authorized users can access the system. There are other
            security measures taken both in front end and back end to ensure the security. Only
            logged in users can send request.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
            <span role="img" aria-label="2">ðŸ–¥</span>What was hard to do?
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            <p>Since this is my first time working in React and I didn't know it at all before,
              it took a while to learn and understand how to work with it. <br/>
              After I got the hang of React, everything went quite smoothly.</p>
